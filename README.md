# SimpleImageSegmentation Repo

**This repo contains information on some simple image segmentation algorithms.**
I have selected 5 images from Berkeley Segmentation Dataset and applied 4 segmented algorithms to them.

 
## Introduction

Image segmentation means partitioning a digital image into some multiple parts.
The proposed segmentation approaches included color, regions and, contours segmentations.
Some major ways to segmentation is, Thresholding, Edge-Based Segmentation,
and Region-based segmentation.  First, five images of the US Berkeley dataset 
were used for this code and for the comparison I used the images provided
in the data set that includes the visual for the naked eye which was provided in the above dataset.

## The Code

**Main.m** - *Contains the Basic code with necessary comments*
**Ms.m** - *Contains Mean shift Algorithm*
